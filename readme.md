# Let's get Internship Ready!

üëãüèΩ Hello there! Congratulations on being shortlisted for an internship opportunity at NxtJob. This document outlines your task, which should be ideally submitted within 5 days.

## Next Steps

To advance in this opportunity, complete the following tasks and submit a PR (Pull Request) to this repository.

Your task is to build a community app where users can post content, receive real-time updates, react to posts, and comment on each other's posts.

2. Explain, in your own words, the difference between "Edge Serverless" and "Serverless".
3. Describe when and where you usually encounter bugs in your development process.
4. Discuss the importance of maintaining clean and readable code. What best practices do you follow to structure and write code for ease of reading?

2. What are your most-used IDE and keyboard shortcuts when coding?
3. How do you approach the design and implementation of a scalable backend system? Feel free to attach code snippets for better explanation.
